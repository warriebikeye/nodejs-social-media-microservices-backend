Auth Service: Handles user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
MySQL Service: Manages CRUD operations for user posts (relational data).
MongoDB Service: Manages comments and interactions (non-relational data).
Redis Service: Caches frequent queries and improves performance.
Cassandra Service: Handles bulk data for activities or logs, ideal for large-scale write-heavy operations.
